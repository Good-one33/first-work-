                I finaly did it, I always used to write but this time I made it public,
                I just wanted to improve my english I decided three days ago to work on
                my self, I often make such decisions but this time I am taking it
                seriously, from today and so on I will always write where ever I am,
                even if I don't really know what to talk about but I do believe that my
                minde will neveer let me out of ideas it will bring me happyness, all
                what he is asking for is <b> Thrust</b>

                I know I didn't write last two days, but if I didn't write here it means
                that I wrote somewhere else, yes of cours I do have an agenda. we all
                have some stuff that we don't really want to share with anyone else
                especially when we don't know who is the reader
                <br />
                anyway, work still in progress it's early to claim victory I just
                started but I can feel a change, after drooping all booring apps from my
                phone I have lot of time and I can do more things I feel quiet and I
                look calm in my daily life, like for example when I am in the bus or the
                RER I can sit down while keeping my posture stright I don't bow tho his
                majesty The Mobile Phone. <br />
        
                <i
                    >é gros, tu exagères la ! tu t'es séparé de tes putaines d'applis
                    quelques jours et tu commences dèja à te la raconter, ça va pas la
                    tête ou quoi ! tu penses vraiment que je vais te laisser me priver de
                    tous les plaisirs que le digital nous a offert? je te dis une chose tu

                    man la!

                <br />
                I know it's booring and hard to change habits, it will take a bit of
                time and we will find an alternative to all these distractions, believe
                me this will take our life to the next level and by the way do you know
                that the gym will open wensday ? in two days you can shape your body
                again and work on your handstand I know you like that so just keep calme

                  Is that a new resolution ?  the beginning of a new month ,my month of birth is 
                  August I am getting older, time is going so fast, especially when you feel that 
                  you didn't do anything in the day, empty days  you know ! <br>
                  The more you live experinces the more you get wiser, all experiences are good for 
                  our self progression, I am always trying to make good things in my life, I am risking
                  a lot and I always  didn't succeed but I will keep trying, I don't  care when I will get 
                  what I am looking for but I am enjoying the fact that I am doing my best and I am 
                  learning new things  <br>

                  <br> Hello dude, no I am feeling great, happy to see you and enjoy your stupid jokes,
                  I am wondring  what did you do all this period, have you been wasting your time 
                  did you learn new thing,made a lot of money, find a girlfriend or at least an intenship 
                  
                  <br><i> hey english man va !, ne t'excites pas trop, on t'a pas appris a fermer un peu ta bouche et 
                    a ne pas te mêler de la vie des autres ! mais que est ce que ça peut te faire de savoir si 
                  j'ai une meuf ou pas !   je suis prêt à causer parce que je m'ennuie et je veux passer un 
                peu de temps avec toi, mais cmomme je t'ai dit, reflichis un peu avant de poser tes questions
              ne balances pas comme ça des phrase comme un con ! </i> <br>
              calm down you too, don't talk to me in a such way, show some respect to your best friend, yes you are 
              right, some stuff aren't my business  but  I really do care about you and I am interested in your way 
              of thinking, I can feel a great  potential coming out of you, but you're not doing what you should do 
              to take advantage of that, you always take things lightly and never go all the way to become a successful
              person and live your life to the fullest and help people around you

                  Today is a great day,it's my birthday, in a tuesday like this one, at 3 am in the 
                  morning I opened my eyes for the first time and I said  <i>" Hello world it's 
                  me, Abdelmalek :) "</i>. <br> This afternoon I was laying in the bad and I started 
                  thinking and imagining the world without me, like what if I didn't existe what 
                  will change ? and to be honest I didn't find a significant contribution, till 
                  now my life is like a 7 billion people's life in this world. <br>
                  I always dreamed big, I had a bunch of amazing things that I wanted to do but 
                  something was stopping me, I was afraid !  the fear of not getting things done,
                  fear of being rejected, but this was the past, now I am seeing things differently
                  I will go all the way to be the person I always wanted to be,<br>
                    <i> wish me a good luck and  a happy birthday :)</i>

                    I am listening to this song, it is so cool, next time I will try to play it in background
                    when you came check one of my black boxes,so you can enjoy the song :)  I have a lot of things and features that I want
                    to add to my space. For now I am just trying to keep writing regulary, it makes me feel better
                    and progressing with my english,  I will try as possible as I can to not stop even one time,
                    when you keep doing something it will become a habit and this one is a good habit <br>
                    it's not easy to find a subject to  talk about, especially when you are alone,but I am lucky, my dear friend 
                    is always here next to me when I want to discuss and express myself,  no he isn't a real person, I 
                    just created him like that, in my mind <br>

                    I don't know who said that but I agree, I was a good book reader few months ago, I stopped for a while 
                    and it became a long break, I was busy with my studies, work, student job, shaping my body in the gym and 
                    more important of all is spending a lot of hours looking and preparing for internships and being not selected
                    at the end !  it's heart break  but I should keep going until I'll join a great company. <br>
                    anyway, it's not easy to be a writer, I mean a real writer,  you should  be smart and wise to be able to writ 
                    a book, I am stragling to make even a correcte sentences, I know it's not easy when you are a begginer with the language
                    but it's not an excuse, the more important in a book is the idea and the way of  describing things, what I like
                    when I read a story is when you can't guess what will happen next, you became curious and you have to read the book
                    until the end
